# Notes

- Using the canvas directly, writing my own animation loop management stuff.
- Boxes for measurements on each axis of x, y, and z.
- Actually may need angle stuff too. I need to go through more old lectures...
- Lines for the beams between the boxes.
- The measurement only happens if the beams go to different places though.
- If the beams go to the same place they can't be distinguished, and the measurement doesn't disrupt the other ones.
