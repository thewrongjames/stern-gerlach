# To Do

- Place boxes in particular locations.
- Canvas zoom-able.
- Recentre the canvas.
- Make the control box width better.
- Reset / clear the state.
- Store the state in local storage and load it when the page loads.
- Have the ability to download and upload state.
- Tests?
- Select and move the boxes.
- Connect the boxes with lines.

## Maybe?

- Enforce storing a position (top left) and vector to bottom right of bounding box on a drawable.
- If I don't have other types, remove the types directory and move drawble to a comment in models/drawables/index.js.
- A mouse-up off the canvas maybe shouldn't complete the action.\
- Infinite tiling position canvas, intelligently deciding which should have anything
  drawn to them (and handling things that overlap two)...
